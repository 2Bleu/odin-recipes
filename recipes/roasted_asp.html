        <li><h4>How to Trim Asparagus</h4>
            <p>The quickest and easiest way to trim your asparagus is to line up all the (clean) stalks on a cutting board, then use a sharp chef’s knife to cut off the thick ends. That’s all there is to it! If you’re worried about cutting at the wrong place, here’s a tip from recipe creator swedishmilk: “To remove woody ends, grab a stalk of asparagus at either end and bend until it snaps. It will naturally snap where it starts to get tough.”</p></li>
        <li><h4>How to Season Asparagus</h4>
            <p>This asparagus is simply seasoned with fresh garlic, sea salt, and black pepper. Parmesan cheese and fresh lemon juice also lend tons of flavor. This is a versatile recipe, so feel free to add spices and customize the seasonings to suit your taste.</p></li>
    
        <li><h4>How to Cook Asparagus In the Oven</h4>
            <p>Roasting asparagus couldn’t be easier: Toss the asparagus with olive oil and sprinkle it with cheese and seasonings. Arrange the stalks in a single layer in a baking dish, then bake until tender. Sprinkle the roasted asparagus with lemon juice before serving, if you like. </p></li>
        <li><h4>How Long to Bake Asparagus</h4>
            <p>In an oven preheated to 425 degrees F, the asparagus should be perfectly roasted after about 12 to 15 minutes. </p></li>
